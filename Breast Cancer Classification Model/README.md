In this project, I made a multi-class classification of breast cancer, trained on CSV data, which are adapted from the [Wisconsin dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). 
The neural network was trained to predict the new data whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign. 
Within the CSV files, the column labeled '_diagnosis_' has two values, 0 and 1, where a value of 1 indicates a malignant cancer and a 0 indicates a benign one. 

This model reached (number) of accuracy 

The files in Results are:
* my_model.json: Contains the model architecture, i.e. the type and size of each layer.
* my_model.weights.bin: Contains the weights of the model.
